# Tension Session

**Tension Session** is a gym companion app designed to make your workouts more effective and easier to track.  

## Key Features
- **Simple, approachable design** – Many apps out there are unapproachable to weight-lifting beginners like myself, but Tension Session is simple.  
- **Rest timer** – Tracks the duration between sets so you rest the right amount.
- **Progress tracking** – See your weight trends for each exercise and monitor strength gains over time.  
- **Apple Watch integration** – Seamlessly syncs data so you can track workouts on your phone or watch.  

## Why I Built Tension Session

When I started going to the gym more regularly in college, I used a spreadsheet to log reps and weights. But spreadsheets designed for big screens were cumbersome on my phone. On top of that, I often lost track of time between sets while reading articles on my phone when resting between sets.   

I wanted a simple app that could: 
1. Track weight progressions over time.  
2. Time my rest periods and remind me when to get back to lifting.
